Here is the cleaned and condensed text:

**Effective Teams**

* Definition: "We reliably deliver high-quality work product. Client satisfaction"

**2021 Challenges**

* Google.org: Client recycled creative from previous campaign; required leadership to step in on client comms; project ran 5 months late
* Dropbox Virtual First: Client didn't feel they got enough output for the cost of the work; BD lead had to step in
* Eventbrite Reconvene: Critical tech failures; required apology to team and CEO
* Levi's Music Project: Client lacked confidence in on-time delivery; dept. head took over client comms; process and team changes
* Amazon Sustainability: Client lacked confidence and visibility; project delayed by months
* Sonos Social Content: Assets did not perform; client didn't see value; project delayed by months

**Some Takeaways**

* Issues with client satisfaction (from client perspective)
* Inability to produce job as initially scoped
* Inflexible to changing client needs/wants
* Perception of high cost, low value (ROI)
* Poor performance of marketing material

**2022 Effectiveness**

* Team growth
* Client Satisfaction Surveys: developing as a practice in 2022; using NPS; light polling, texting, milestone check-ins, mission-oriented feedback

**Profitable?**

* "We are reinvesting in the business and consistently making profit distributions"
* Imprint lost $322K in Net Income in 2021

**2021 Finances**

* Biz Dev: sold a breakeven year ($6M); potential loss of $104,875 due to Special Rate Cards (Google, Sonos, Amazon, Levi's)
* Levi's Special Rate Card ended at the end of 2021

**Variance from SOW**

* Biggest issue: variance from SOW estimate
* Root causes: planning, client relationships, clear scopes, client expectations, accuracy of estimate, project durations, project complexity, performance

**Proposed Solutions**

* Hire more experienced, long-term team members in production and strategy
* Training; role clarification

**Utilization Rates**

* Bigger issue than it appears
* Factors: non-work days, holidays, PTO, sick, personal days; number of hours worked per week; number of hours expected to work on projects per week
* Imprint saved $231K from project team members who worked in excess of 40 hours a week

**2022 Budget**

* Revenue: $9M
* Breakeven: $6.5M
* Biz Dev: allocating $160K more than 2021 to scale
* Hiring: currently 1 more EP and 1 Strategy Director on the roadmap for FTEs

**2022 Bonuses**

* Bonus philosophy: incentivize performance, reward collective success, attract and retain talent
* Three ways to receive bonuses: Individual Performance Bonus, Company Performance Bonus, Profit Share

**Durable?**

* "Our offering is distinct, competitively defensible, and encourages long-term partnership"
* Platforms Retainers: $1.655M in 2021; $3M in 2022
