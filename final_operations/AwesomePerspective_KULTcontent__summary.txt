At KULT, we enable experiences that bring meaning to people and lead them to take action. We aim to be awesome because awe is transformational, a catalyst for innovation that creates purpose and fuels motivation. 

**Cultural Foresight**
Learn to anticipate the future by contextualizing and decoding cultural signals that influence your sector.

**Human Insights**
Understand the human experience, meet people in their real context, and learn about their perspectives and motivations.

**Design Strategy**
Activate findings, galvanize crowds, and create purpose people can get behind.

**Unveiling Awesome Perspectives**
Seek perspective to find purpose. Human Experience (HX) is involved in all aspects of an organization. HX design helps define organizational structure and culture, technology, product, service, and brand innovation.

KULT's approach is based on three principles of the experience spectrum, and custom research and strategy programs are offered for specific needs.

Planning for an optimal human experience requires engagement to get perspective directly from people, not projecting our own. This is the only accurate way to understand another viewpoint and solve problems effectively.

The source of conflict and failure is often the inability to see things from another person's point of view. Successful collaborations rely on realizing others may see things differently and conceptualizing where they're coming from by engaging with them.

**Foresight**
Understand how culture influences and is influenced by individuals. Context, tribes, and phenomena that galvanize crowds are elements of trends that signal change.

**Insight**
Experience is individually based on past associations, emotions aren't fixed, and personas won't do justice to the complexity of HX. Understanding your audience is critical to identifying assumptions, perceptions, and the lens through which they see you. HX research unveils higher-level human motivations and taps into awe-inspiring concepts that fuel change.
