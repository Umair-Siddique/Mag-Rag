THE KULT MANIFESTO
THE ROLE OF EMOTIONAL CONCEPTS IN THE PERFECTION OF EXPERIENCES

Day-to-day living and long-term quality of life are important elements of Kahneman's thinking, expressed in his concept of the "two selves": the "Experiencing Self" and the "Remembering Self."

The Experiencing Self lives in the present, processing current inputs and information. Kahneman calculated that the psychological presence of an experience lasts about three seconds.

The Remembering Self writes the story of our lives, and our memories are defined by change. The lesson for luxury goods marketers is to satisfy the needs of the Experiencing Self and provide experiential change that the Remembering Self can use to create memories.

Kahneman made a distinction about how experience and memory affect our future behavior: "We actually don't choose between experiences, we choose between memories of experiences."

CULTURE AND EMOTIONS AS COLLECTIVELY CONSTRUCTED CONCEPTS

Emotions are concepts constructed by our individual neural systems, molded by our cultures and past experiences. Barrett says, "what we call emotions are concepts constructed by our individual neural systems, molded by our cultures and past experiences."

Emotions are social reality, and much of what we do, feel, and think each day is determined by social reality. We impose meaning collectively as a group.

DESIGNING FOR THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE (HX)

Human experience looks beyond commercial needs to understand and meet human desires such as freedom, identity, and creation. Companies that prioritize HX deliver meaningful experiences that build relevance and value with their customers.

HX is a function of several experiences: CX, EX, LX, IX, VX, TX. Humanity and emotion are at the heart of everything we experience in our interaction with organizations.

We have fallen behind the technology development curve and are stressed as a result. 80% of respondents in a global study demanded a personal touch in all digital channels, and 79% want a human to be part of the connecting channels.

The top driver for CX is the level of interest shown by the employer in me as a person and individual. The concept of immediate gratification has become faster, and our patience is thinner.

HX is defined by the experiences we have as customers (CX) not just with one particular organization, but with all organizations we interact with.

HX principles:

1. Live your purpose. Purpose is the bedrock of HX.
2. Consciously align all that you do. Use purpose as the driver and filter for every business decision.
3. Elevate interactions through cognitive understanding. Harness data, explore patterns, and study shifting human values.
4. Infuse insights across an adaptive ecosystem. Rapidly respond to customer needs and evolve to meet changing market demands.
5. Invest in the now and the next. Delivering HX requires organizational commitment.

ABOUT HUMAN'S FUNDAMENTAL NEED TO FIND MEANING

The final need in the hierarchy is the need for self-actualization (fulfilling one's potential). Purpose is a fundamental component of a fulfilling life. Adopting a pre-existing framework of purpose and meaning, such as religion, can provide a clear purpose.

Infuse insights across an adaptive ecosystem. Companies should rapidly respond to customer needs and evolve to meet changing market demands. Test frequently, research, learn by doing, and adjust constantly.

Invest in the now and the next. HX is a major shift in both internal and external relationships, and, like any relationship, it takes cultivation. Delivering HX requires organizational commitment.

HX-driven economy

The final need in the hierarchy is the need for self-actualization (fulfilling one's potential). Purpose is a fundamental component of a fulfilling life.

**Frameworks of Purpose and Meaning**

* Religion: provides a clear purpose, e.g., worshiping God and Jesus Christ
* Sport: provides a sense of purpose, e.g., team winning
* Personal and Spiritual Development:
 * Self-exploration and creativity
 * Spiritual development through practices like meditation

**Transcendence and Meaning**

People seek to transcend biological existence. This sense of death-transcendence can come from:

* Having children
* Creating lasting legacies
* Investing in groups or organizations that outlast individual members
* Religion

To feel meaningful is to feel like you made a lasting mark. Humans are meaning-making animals.

**Culture**

Cultures are complexes of learned behavior patterns and perceptions.

**Brand as People**

Research shows that we perceive brands as people. Brands have to simulate the actual experience of humans they'll end up impacting.

**The Case for Understanding HX**

Applying behavioral science to companies' primary functions:

* Creating the best product
* Reaching users who want that product
* Managing an efficient and ethical organization

**Brands and Self-Concept**

Consumers utilize brands as symbols in expressing one's self-concept. Consumers make evaluations of brands based on perceived similarity between their own self-concept and perceived human personalities that they view in brands.

**The Imperative of Brand-Organizational Responsibility**

Responsibility has become the most problematic aspect of almost all human actions. The problem of responsibility is a sign of the crisis which we experience now.

**The Need to Create Emotional Resonance**

KULT is a human experience (HX) research and strategy company. KULT is based on the idea that whatever change we bring into the world, we have a responsibility to anticipate the ramifications of this change.

By taking our brand blinders off, we have an opportunity to create experiences bigger than ourselves. Align with other brands that live out similar values, to stand for causes believed in, and manifest a sense of purpose and meaning worthy of people's awe.

Here is the cleaned and condensed text:

KULT is based on the idea that change has ramifications. Brands influence and are influenced by culture. Experience design is more than the sum of touchpoints users have with a brand.

Hyperkulturemia is found in contemplations of awe-inspiring and terrifying things, triggering positive emotions like awe, wonder, and gratitude.

UNDERSTANDING HUMAN EXPERIENCE: THE NEW BUSINESS IMPERATIVE

Design helps people deal with change. Dev Patnaik: "Creating empathy for our user is a buzz word. This is our job as designers to continue making decisions until the purpose of the design is perfectly clear."

Roger Martin: Everything is subject to innovation, not just physical objects but also systems, policies, and user experiences.

SPARKGROVE

Business must think of human experience as serving customer needs. Futuring offers a strategic and creative process to anticipate and plan for the long-term.

Companies that prioritize experience design will elevate and differentiate their experience, leading to deeper relationships and sustained growth.

To create meaningful experiences, serve higher-level needs like building community or supporting self-actualization. Be transformative or purpose-driven.

HX demands a new mandate and operating structure, one focused on human relationships and purpose over profit.

Brands can learn from the notion of awe and apply it across the experience spectrum. A framework for designing awesome experiences includes:

* Contextualize: cultural experience
* Conceptualize: emotional experience
* Engage: physiological experience

Human experience is influenced by multiple touchpoints and forms of experience design.

Context evolves with culture. Humans belong to multiple social hierarchies, and each context transforms how we act, think, behave, and emote.

We can learn from history and past experiences to create new attitudes towards new experiences.

Conceptualize new experiences by filtering emotions and perceptions through past experiences.

Loyalty means trust. People see brands like people, evaluating them based on perceived similarity to their self-concept.

The experiences that impact us most are those that bring about change, as they're the most memorable.

Meaning and purpose become more important, not just from a generational standpoint.

We must look at different ways to measure interactions, prioritizing quality and social impact.

Companies' relationships with followers start from the minute they launch a new product or invention.

Employees must simulate the experiences they create to anticipate impact.

Technologies and humans interact; design must consider the human experience component.

Methods like design thinking help build consensus and products from multidisciplinary perspectives.

Research is needed at all stages, and qualitative methods are critical. 

Otherwise, followers will create the brand and communicate its reputation.

About awe: 
meaning and purpose are new brand imperatives. 
We live in a dystopian era with a wave of utopian feelings. 
Many studies show pop-up models create novelty; people like that.

Awe: 
the science of awe makes us feel smaller, enables change, and generosity. 
Meaning and purpose are emotional, not functional.
