**Overarching Philosophy**

Heads of departments are crucial to company leadership. Collaboration between department heads improves team performance and solves project challenges. Each department head is responsible for the quality of work and overall experience of their department.

No department is more important than another. Projects may lean heavier on some departments, and responsibilities shift between departments naturally.

Department heads are advocates for their team, other teams, and the company as a whole. "The best producer understands the task of a strategist, and has opinions about creative."

**Amendment to Job Description**

This amendment adds to individual job descriptions (e.g., Creative Director, Executive Producer, Strategy Director). The Department Head role requires reduced project work and increased managerial work.
